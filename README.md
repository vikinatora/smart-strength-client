<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This application started as a university project for the Software Technologies course in TU-Sofia. Our team had to come up with an interesting idea that is bussiness 
viable and hasn't been implemented before, write [architecure and project documents](https://github.com/vikinatora/smart-strength-client/tree/master/documentation), 
implement the applicaiton, test it and present it. 

As everybody from our team worked out I came up with the idea of an application which after a series of questions, uses science based expert system to create a workout 
plan and diet regime which meets the user's needs. Using the application users can keep track of their progress using a workout log and ocassionally share their 
workout achievements mid training which creates the social media twist of the app.

I think this concept really makes the application stand out. And it kinda worked... If it wasn't for the deadlines we had to meet the project could have been implemented much better.
That's why there's [Smart Strength V2](https://github.com/smart-strength) in the making.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

See the [open issues](https://github.com/vikinatora/smart-strength-client/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).

This project has been canceled as it started as a university project. This meant that the tech stack had to relatively simple in order to make it possibble for my team memmbers to collaborate, didn't expoect to do most of the work myself,
had to meet deadlines which combined led to poor design and architecture decision. After presenting the project I decided the code is bad and isn't worth refactoring but 
I really liked the idea of the app and now [Smart Strength V2](https://github.com/smart-strength) is in progress.
